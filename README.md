Level 4: Developer completes all projects(spaceships) and all challenges(stars).
Level 3: Developer completes all projects(spaceships) and some challenges and has read some documents(articles)
Level 2: Developer completes most projects and some challenges and has read some articles.
Level 1: Developer completes some projects and some challenges and some articles.

Into this repository you will:
- Have the code for two projects
- Have a readme with evidence of what the project looks like and an explanation of what it does.

To achieve Level 4 on this section you will have to show me your profile on Algorithms in person. I am not able to check this without it.

# Selection Sort
This program takes an array of numbers and sorts it in order from least to greatest. It loops through the array and compares two numbers, swapping them if the second number is smaller than the first. Four arrays are displayed being sorted, with lines to show where each number goes after each step.
# Recursive Art
This program draws squares that half in width and change colour after each recursion, only stopping when the width of the square reaches a certain number. The function to draw the square is called inside the function itself, making it recursive.
